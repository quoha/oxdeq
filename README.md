Ox double-ended queue

Simple double ended queue with has no understanding of the
data that it is storing. OxDeq supports push/pop/peek operations
to the front and back of the queue. OxDeq supports reversing the
data (which is odd because you could just push/pop from the
other end of the queue to do the same thing).
